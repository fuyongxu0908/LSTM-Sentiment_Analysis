0,apparently prides osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at  on a friday night however new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive by  pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been perhaps beverly residents prefer a later seating after reading the mixed reviews of late i was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department we started with the fried dough burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely then although they dont offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them we chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon asparagus and grana frita both were very good we split a secondi which was the special berkshire pork secreto which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert we ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty portions are not huge which i particularly like because i prefer to order courses if you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over  set would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although i personally dont know the former glory to be able to compare easy access to downtown salem without the crowds on this month of october,4.0,pos
1,this store is pretty good not as great as walmart or my preferred milford target but closer and in a easier area to get to  the store itself is pretty clean and organized the staff are friendly most of the time and best of all is the self checkout this store has great clearance sections throughout and great prices on everything in the store in general they pricematch too christian debbie jen and hanna are all very friendly helpful sensitive to all customer needs definitely one of the better target locations in the area and they do a great job assisting customers for being such a busy store located directly in the framingham mall on cochituate rd  route   stars,4.0,pos

11,disappointing bolt is a follow up of fannys fabrics which closed like fannys the selection is small the fabrics lean toward contemporary they also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order however they dont have enough room to display their selections so its like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle the woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful however my mother and i both bought fabric there and we both had the same problem the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration i brought my pillow forms with me so there was no doubt exactly how large they were my mother was able to make her project work but i came up a pillow short by the time the pillows were made i realized i was short and i returned to bolt all in a months time the fabric had sold out with no plans on reordering fortunately for me i was just making a number of large throw pillows now i dont have the number i wanted but i can be flexible what if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed obviously unacceptable my advise is to feel free and shop here but figure out your measurements on your own,2.0,neg
12,i have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times i got a burger with caramelized onions a red wine sauce and i believe blue cheese the first time it was excellent and just the right size for me i hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that i cant even finish half of flips burgers are about the same size i would make for myself at homethe second time i went i had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie and a very sweet syrupy sauce which i could have done without but overall it was very good i also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings ive had everthe only thing i dont really like about flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables i guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever but it makes me feel as if i am in a school cafeteria back in high school i dont like it there are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from ikea its also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound like a school cafeteriathe last time i was in there there were a couple of women with small children i have no idea why someone would bring a child to flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater they dont make anything plain everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients its also very pricy for burgers this is the last place on earth i would bring kids to eat burger king is right down the street,4.0,pos
